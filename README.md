# Ill-make-a-man-out-of-you.
This is part of the lyrics from a popular song that comes from Mulan. The song is called Ill make a man out of you by Danny Osmond.

Let's get down to business
To defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters
When I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you
Tranquil as a forest
But on fire within
Once you find your center
You are sure to win

You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you
I'm never gonna catch my breath!
Say goodbye to those who knew me!
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym?
This guy got 'em scared to death!
Hope he doesn't see right through me!
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim!

(Be a man!)
You must be swift as a coursing river
(Be a man!)
With all the force of a great typhoon
(Be a man!)
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order and you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home you're through
How could I make a man out of you?
